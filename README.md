### Hello everyone üëã,

My name is Grzegorz Romaniuk and I have decided to make some changes in my life and join the IT sector. For years I have been passionately teaching English to people of all ages, mostly teenagers, but recently I began to feel the need for diversity, development and new challenges. 

Communication and collaboration have always been high on my priorities list when it comes to the job description. The fact that scrum has been growing in popularity among IT companies, and I wholeheartedly support this approach, made IT an appealing choice. What cemented it for me, though, was the fact that, for as long as I can remember, I have loved solving puzzles, optimizing my work and analysing the best methods to fulfil my goals - both in my professional life (choosing the best teaching strategies) as well as hobbies (city-building, RPG and strategic PC & board games ;) ).

I am now looking to join a team with whom I will be able to grow and who are going to appreciate my being able have great conversation with potential business partners, openness to learning new things, attention to detail, and no small amount of sense of humour ;).

**üòÑ In the five months since I became serious about changing my line of work I have learnt:**
- object-oriented programming (mostly in Python, but I have started learning C# too and I can see a lot of potential there too!)
- reasonable amount of HTML & CSS to independently write what I want and make it look acceptably good (I'm aware that there is some room for improvement there =) ).
- how to use SQL on the basis of SQLite 3 and some MSSQL

These things are demonstrated in a Flask program [here](https://github.com/Axis1991/MonthlyBudget), which is deployed on https://axis91.pythonanywhere.com/

- to write unit, functional and integration tests (see [here](https://github.com/Axis1991/Budget_for_testing/tree/budget_tests_for_review))
- the theory of professional testing (ISTQB Foundation Level Certificate)
- to work in scrum framework (PSM 1 Certificate)
- how to write code according to DRY, KISS, YAGNI etc. to the extent it makes sense
- use Azure DevOps to collaborate in projects
- perhaps most importantly - how to look for information using forums, documentation and some AI tools, to get me where I need to be with my code.

**üå± I‚Äôm looking forward to:**
- develop my knowledge about C#, .Net and Entity Framework
- getting to know how to use the python knowledge I have in Django framework

**üëØ I‚Äôm currently collaborating on:**
- a non-profit project for church community as part-time scrum master and Frontend/C# developer using Blazor (early stages)

**ü§ù I you are looking for someone ambitious and outgoing who wants share their dedication and positive outlook on life with others, don't hesitate to reach out to me!**
